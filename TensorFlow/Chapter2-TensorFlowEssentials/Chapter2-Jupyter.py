''' Before loading a Jupyter notebook, it is important that you
cd into the directory containing .ipynb files.'''
# cd ~/directoryOfInteret

''' You can launch Jupyter notebooks by entering the following
command into the terminal'''
# jupyter notebook

'''Running the previous command should launch a new browser window
with the Jupyter notebook dashboard. If no window automatically opens
up, you can manually navigate to http://localhost:8888 from any browser'''

''' You can create a new notebook by clicking the dropdown menu on the
top right labeled "New", under "Notebooks", choose "Python 3". This creates
a new file called "Untitled.ipynb" which you can immediately start editing
through the browser interface.'''

''' Everything in the Jupyter notebook is an independent chunk of code or
text called a cell. They help divide a long block of code into manageable
pieces of code snippets and documentation. You can run cells individually,
or choose to run everything at once, in order. There the three common ways
to evaluate cells:

    1. Pressing Shift+Enter on a cell executes the cell and highlights the
    next cell below.

    2. Pressing Ctrl+Enter will maintain the cursor on the current cell after
    executing it.

    3. And last, pressing Alt+Enter will execute the cell and then insert a
    new empty cell directly below.
'''

''' You can change the cell type by clicking the dropdown in the toolbar.
Alternatively, you can press Esc to leave edit mode, use the arrow keys to
highlight a cell, and hit Y to change it to code mode or M for markdown mode.
